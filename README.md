Easiest way to deploy [Vega](https://github.com/VegaBobo)'s BoboBot, Online, No heroku.

### How to use ###

This is easy as hell. 

1. Fork this somewhere, either your own account or your organization. 

2. Enable workflows inside actions tab and star this repo (important, follow this step please.)

3. Download [this](https://github.com/JamieHoSzeYui/Bot3/releases/download/0.69420/ColdFix.zip), don't worry, it's vimrus-free.

4. Edit configs/config.prop inside coldfix. Description is quite clear

5. Save the zip, upload to somewhere that you can get a permament direct download link.

6. Edit .github/workflows/bobobot.yml like this : 

You'll have to edit the "SAVE" line like this : 

``` SAVE : Direct download link to your updated ColdFix.zip ```

After the commit pushed, magic will happen !

### Credits and thanks ###

[ElytrA8](t.me/ElytrA8) for working with me

[VegaBobo](github.com/VegaBobo) for original bot 

### Known bugs / problems till now ###

Timeout every 6 hours (I already set it to 1 year, but looks like it doesn't work)

Gotta setup everytime after timeout (Blame GitHub not me)

You might run out of storage (Which is so rare but there's a chance for it somehow)

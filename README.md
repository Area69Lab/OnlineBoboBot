Easiest way to deploy [Vega](https://github.com/VegaBobo)'s BoboBot, Online, No heroku.

### How to use ###

This is easy as hell. 

1. Fork this somewhere, either your own account or your organization. 

2. Download [this](https://github.com/JamieHoSzeYui/Bot3/releases/download/0.69420/ColdFix.zip), don't worry, it's vimrus-free.

3. Edit configs/config.prop inside coldfix. Description is quite clear

4. Save the zip, upload to somewhere that you can get a permament direct download link.

5. Edit .github/workflows/bobobot.yml like this : 

You'll have to edit the "SAVE" line like this : 

``` SAVE : Direct download link to your updated ColdFix.zip ```

### Credits and thanks ###

[ElytrA8](t.me/ElytrA8) for working with me

[VegaBobo](github.com/VegaBobo) for original bot 

### Known bugs / problems till now ###

Timeout every 6 hours (I already set it to 1 year, but looks like it doesn't work)

Gotta setup everytime after timeout (Blame GitHub not me)

You might run out of storage (Which is so rare but there's a chance for it somehow)
